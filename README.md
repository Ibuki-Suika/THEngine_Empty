# THEngine_Empty

This is a game engine under development.

There are two ways to use this engine:

- Directly clone this repository and open in Visual Studio 2013 or higher version.

- copy the THEngine.zip and paste to UserProfile/Document/Your VS Version/Templates/ProjectTemplates. Then open the Visual Studio, and select File>>New>>Project, then choose the template 'THEngine' and create it.

Have fun with that!
